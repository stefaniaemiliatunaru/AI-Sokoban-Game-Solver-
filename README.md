# AI-Sokoban-Game-Solver-
An Artificial Intelligence project that implements and compares the IDA* and Simulated Annealing algorithms to find solutions for the Sokoban puzzle game. The project includes custom heuristics (such as weighted Euclidean and Manhattan distances) and analyzes the performance of both algorithms across various map difficulties.
